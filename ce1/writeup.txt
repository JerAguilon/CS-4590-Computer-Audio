If you use a custom UGen (Unit Generator) for your exercise, describe it below:

The reverb UGen sits between the sample player and the gain UGen. From a topological point of view:

Sound Sample --> Gain UGen --> Reverb UGen --> Sample Player

Reverb seems to have 3 parameters: early reflections, room size, and late reverb level. I
opted to make the slider modify the late reverb level while keeping the others constant.
This modifies the impression of the walls of the room.

Both gain and reverb range from 0 to 5, and I scaled the slider values (which range from 0 to 100)
to do this.
