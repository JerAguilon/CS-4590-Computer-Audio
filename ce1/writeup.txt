If you use a custom UGen (Unit Generator) for your exercise, describe it below:

The reverb UGen sits between the sample player and the gain UGen. From a topological point of view:

Sound Sample --> Gain UGen --> Reverb UGen --> Sample Player

Reverb seems to have 3 parameters: early reflections, room size, and late reverb level. I
opted to make the slider modify the late reverb level while keeping the others constant.
This seems to reasonably give the impression of a more reflective room.
in.

Both gain and reverb range from 0 to 5, and I scaled the slider values (which range from 0 to 100)
to do this.
