Background environment

I recorded about 20 seconds of a coffee shop in Edgewood. The shop
was fairly busy at the time, but people are generally quieter there
(at least compared to GT Starbucks!).

Book Excerpt

The quote I chose was from Lewis Carrol's Alice in Wonderland:

"Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in
the same place. If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at
least twice as fast as that!"
